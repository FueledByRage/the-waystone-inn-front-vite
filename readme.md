[API](https://github.com/FueledByRage/waystone-inn-backend-typescript)

# Why:
This project worked as a lab to improve my skills in web development. Here i've practiced and learned things that are base to how i work today.
This version is actually a migration from a [first version](https://github.com/FueledByRage/The-Waystone-Inn-Frontend) in CRA to Vite, a more efficient frontend tooling that i used on my first job as frontend.

# Observation
It's UI is quite poor yet since design is not my comfort zone and it's in a early development stage.
